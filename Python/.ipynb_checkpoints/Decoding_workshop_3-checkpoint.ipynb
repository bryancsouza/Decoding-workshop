For each trial, one of the two stimulus would be played for 2 seconds (stimulus period) and then, after a 1-sec-window of silence (we call this the trace period), the animal would receive or not a reward (reward period), depending on wich sound was played. Because the stimuli and the reward periods do not overlap, we call this a trace-conditioning task. \n",
