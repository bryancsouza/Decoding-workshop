# Decoding-workshop
Matlab and Python codes showing how machine learning techniques like supervised learning can be used to investigate properties of neural activity. 

In the first part we simulated activity of neurons that are modulated by a stimulus. This activity is then loaded and analyzed in the second part, where we train a SVM classifier to try separating different stimuli based on the simulated population activity.

In the third and last part of the workshop, we use the same approach to analyze neurons from a real dataset.
